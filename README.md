firstly, run this code

First, we start a new project with 1. npm init. It helps us set up our project.

Then, we add two important tools: Express and Mongoose. Express helps us build 
web apps, and Mongoose helps us talk to databases.
2. npm i express mongoose

Next, we add two more tools, dotenv and nodemon. Dotenv keeps our secrets safe, and nodemon helps us see our changes in real-time.
3. npm i --save-dev dotenv nodemon

Finally, we start our server with npm run devstart. 
It keeps an eye on our code and restarts the server whenever we make changes.
Easy, right?
4. npm run devstart


NOTE: make sure to dowload mongodb and connect it.
